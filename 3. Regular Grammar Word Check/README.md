# Word checker for a Regular Grammar in Python

  Python algorithm that get as input a Regular Grammar and a list of words and determines if the string is generated by the grammar or not. 
  
## How to read the input
The algorithm uses 2 input files, one for the grammar and one for the strings.

## The *grammar input file* has the following layout:

S -> aA | bB (S is the start symbol)

A -> a | # (# is a substitute symbol for lambda)

B -> A

## The *word input file* has the following layout:

Every string on its own line, and they are inside a set of **" "**

**""** represents λ(lambda), the empty string

## Example of input files

***grammar input***

``` python
S -> aA | dE
A -> aB | aS
B -> bC
C -> bD | bB
D -> cD | e | #
E -> D
```

***words input***

``` python
"aaaaaad"
"aabbccccce"
""
"aabbcc"
"bbacca"
"aabb"
"bbaac"
"de"
```

## Example of output

``` python
Word aaaaaad is generated by the given grammar.
Word aabbccccce is generated by the given grammar.
Word λ is NOT generated by the given grammar.
Word aabbcc is generated by the given grammar.
Word bbacca is NOT generated by the given grammar.
Word aabb is generated by the given grammar.
Word bbaac is NOT generated by the given grammar.
Word de is generated by the given grammar.
